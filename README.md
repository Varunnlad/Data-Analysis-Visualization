Data Analysis & Visualization Playground
This repository serves as a personal playground and showcase for various data analysis and visualization projects. Here, I explore different datasets, apply various analytical techniques, and create compelling visualizations to uncover insights and communicate findings.

About This Repository
This repository isn't focused on one specific domain or dataset; rather, it's a collection of independent data analysis tasks. Each project within this repo will tackle a unique dataset, ranging from publicly available sources to personal data collections.

My goal is to:

Practice and hone data cleaning, transformation, and analysis skills.
Experiment with different libraries and tools for data manipulation (e.g., Pandas, NumPy) and visualization (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly).
Develop a portfolio of diverse data analysis projects.
Share insights derived from the datasets
